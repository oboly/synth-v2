# TODO — Strategy Candidates

## Status

Open design questions. No implementation yet.

## Source

```text
docs/research/strategy_candidate_horizon_buckets_v1.md
```

## Core rule

```text
Asset != strategy.
```

Correct selection unit:

```text
candidate = (
    asset,
    strategy_family,
    horizon_bucket,
    setup_context,
    validation_state,
)
```

## P2 — Horizon bucket design review

Status: open.

Tasks:

- Decide whether selection_engine should rank per horizon bucket independently.
- Specify how same-asset candidates conflict or reinforce each other.
- Specify how decision_gate resolves exposure when multiple active candidates target the same asset.
- Define graduation rules from `BREATH_CURVE_RESEARCH` to runtime-eligible candidate buckets only after validation.
- Preserve the rule: asset is not a strategy.

## Boundary

```text
selection_engine may rank market-only candidates.
decision_gate resolves account-aware exposure/conflicts/sizing/permission.
execution_planner/executor do not contain candidate logic.
```

No direct buy/sell/order logic belongs here.
